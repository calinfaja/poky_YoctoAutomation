# Jenkins Automation for Yocto Project: Building QEMU on Docker

## 1. Setting up GitHub Repo
To begin automating builds, you need a properly structured GitHub repository. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new GitHub repository or clone an existing one.
2. Add the necessary Yocto project files and configurations to the repository.
3. Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes temporary or unnecessary build files.
4. Commit and push your changes to the remote repository.

## 2. Setting up Jenkins Automation
Jenkins will be used to automate the build process. Here's how to set it up:

1. Install Jenkins on your system or use a cloud-hosted Jenkins service.
2. Install required plugins, such as:
   - **Git Plugin**: For cloning the repository.
   - **Pipeline Plugin**: To manage complex build steps.
   - **Docker Plugin**: To run builds inside Docker containers.
3. Create a new pipeline job and configure it to clone the GitHub repository.
4. Define the pipeline script (`Jenkinsfile`) in the repository with stages for fetching dependencies, setting up the environment, and triggering the build.

## 3. Setting up Docker Containers
Docker ensures a consistent and isolated build environment. Steps:

1. Install Docker on your host machine.
2. Create a `Dockerfile` for your Yocto project. Example:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:20.04

   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
       git \
       build-essential \
       qemu \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

   WORKDIR /yocto
